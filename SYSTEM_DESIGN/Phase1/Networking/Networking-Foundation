1️⃣ Client–Server Model
-----
What is a Client?
   ⏺️ Browser (Chrome)
   ⏺️ Mobile app
   ⏺️ Postman
What is a Server?
   ⏺️ Backend application
   ⏺️ Database
   ⏺️ CDN edge server
Flow---
   ➡️ Client → Request → Server
   ➡️ Client ← Response ← Server

📌 System design = designing this communication at scale.

2️⃣ IP Address & Ports
------
🌐 IP Address & Port (DETAILED)
1️⃣ What is an IP Address?
----
🔹 Simple Definition
  ➡️  An IP address is a unique logical address assigned to a device on a network so other devices can find and communicate with it.

Think of it as:
House address 📍 for a device

Without IP:
❌ No communication
❌ Internet cannot work

2️⃣ Why Do We Need IP Addresses?
----
When you send a request:
    Browser → Server

The internet must know:
   ⏺️ Where to send the request
   ⏺️ Where to send the response back

👉 IP solves this.

3️⃣ Types of IP Addresses
-----
IPv4 (Most Common) ----
   ⏺️ 32-bit address
   ⏺️ Written in dotted decimal
       ➡️ 192.168.1.1
Range ➡️ 0.0.0.0  → 255.255.255.255
Total ➡️ 2³² ≈ 4.3 billion addresses
📌 Problem: Not enough IPs

IPv6 (Modern) ----
   ⏺️ 128-bit address
   ⏺️ Hexadecimal
        ➡️ 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334
Benefits
    ✔ Huge address space
    ✔ Better routing
    ✔ No NAT required
📌 Still slow adoption

4️⃣ Public IP vs Private IP (VERY IMPORTANT) ----
🌍 Public IP
   ⏺️ Used on the internet
   ⏺️ Globally unique
   ⏺️ Assigned by ISP
Example: 142.250.183.14 (Google)

🏠 Private IP
   ⏺️ Used inside local networks
   ⏺️ NOT accessible from internet

Reserved Private Ranges:
    10.0.0.0     – 10.255.255.255
    172.16.0.0   – 172.31.255.255
    192.168.0.0  – 192.168.255.255
Example:
    ➡️ 192.168.1.1
📌 Your laptop, phone, TV use private IPs.

5️⃣ NAT (Network Address Translation) -------
🔹 What is NAT?
    ➡️ NAT is a networking technique that allows multiple devices in a private network to access the internet using one public IP address.

👉 It translates private IP addresses → public IP address and vice-versa.

🔹 Why NAT is needed?
   ⏺️ IPv4 addresses are limited
   ⏺️ Internal (private) IPs are not routable on the internet
   ⏺️ Adds a basic layer of security
   ⏺️ Saves cost (one public IP for many devices)

🔹 How NAT works (simple flow)
        Laptop (192.168.1.10)
                ↓
        Router (NAT)
                ↓
        Public IP (103.xx.xx.xx)
                ↓
        Internet

When the response comes back, NAT maps it back to:
    103.xx.xx.xx → 192.168.1.10
    ➡️ Private IP + Port → Public IP + Port

6️⃣ Port – Simple Definition --------
    A port identifies a specific application or service running on a machine.
If IP is:
    Apartment building
Port is:
    Flat number

7️⃣ Why Do We Need Ports? ------
One machine:
   ⏺️ Runs browser
   ⏺️ Runs backend server
   ⏺️ Runs database
   ⏺️ Runs SSH
All use same IP, so:
    👉 Port tells which app should receive the request

8️⃣ Port Range -----
    | Range       | Meaning               |
    | ----------- | --------------------- |
    | 0–1023      | Well-known ports      |
    | 1024–49151  | Registered            |
    | 49152–65535 | Ephemeral (temporary) |

Common Ports (Interview Must) -----
    | Port  | Service    |
    | ----- | ---------- |
    | 80    | HTTP       |
    | 443   | HTTPS      |
    | 22    | SSH        |
    | 21    | FTP        |
    | 3306  | MySQL      |
    | 5432  | PostgreSQL |
    | 6379  | Redis      |
    | 27017 | MongoDB    |

9️⃣ IP + Port = Socket  ---
Example:
    142.250.183.14:443
Means:
   ⏺️ IP → Google server
   ⏺️ Port → HTTPS service

📌 This pair uniquely identifies a connection endpoint.

🔄 Real Request Example (Very Important) ---
When you open:
    https://google.com
Internally:
    1> DNS → 142.250.183.14
    2> Browser connects to: 142.250.183.14:443
    3> HTTPS server responds

3️⃣ DNS (Domain Name System)----
    What DNS Does
       ➡️ Converts domain name → IP address
        google.com → 142.250.183.14
Why DNS Matters in System Design
   ⏺️ Load balancing
   ⏺️ Failover
   ⏺️ Geo-routing
Types of DNS
   ⏺️ A Record → IP
   ⏺️ CNAME → Alias
   ⏺️ MX → Mail

📌 DNS lookup adds latency (~20–100ms)

4️⃣ Request–Response Lifecycle (Very Important) ---
When you open https://example.com:
    1> DNS lookup
    2> TCP handshake
    3> TLS handshake
    4> HTTP request
    5> Server processing
    6> Response sent
    7> Browser renders
👉 Every step adds latency


🟡 PART 2️⃣ – HTTP / HTTPS (Deep Dive) ---------

5️⃣ HTTP is Stateless (Critical Concept) -----
    Server does NOT remember previous requests.
Implications
   ⏺️ Session stored in:
       ⏺️ Cookies
       ⏺️ Redis
       ⏺️ JWT

📌 Stateless = scalable

6️⃣ HTTP Headers (Very Important) ---
Request Headers
   ⏺️ Authorization
   ⏺️ Content-Type
   ⏺️ User-Agent
   ⏺️ Accept
Response Headers
   ⏺️ Cache-Control
   ⏺️ Set-Cookie
   ⏺️ ETag
   ⏺️ CORS headers
📌 Headers control security, caching, performance

7️⃣ HTTP Status Codes (Interview Must) ----
    | Code | Meaning             |
    | ---- | ------------------- |
    | 200  | OK                  |
    | 201  | Created             |
    | 301  | Permanent redirect  |
    | 302  | Temporary redirect  |
    | 400  | Bad request         |
    | 401  | Unauthorized        |
    | 403  | Forbidden           |
    | 404  | Not found           |
    | 429  | Too many requests   |
    | 500  | Server error        |
    | 503  | Service unavailable |
📌 URL shortener uses 301 / 302

8️⃣ HTTPS & TLS Handshake (Advanced but Important) ----
Steps
   1> Client hello
   2> Server certificate
   3> Key exchange
   4> Encrypted communication
Why It Matters
   5> Authentication
   6> Encryption
   7> Trust

📌 TLS handshake is expensive → reuse connections

9️⃣ HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 vs HTTP/3 ----
HTTP/1.1
   ⏺️ One request per connection
   ⏺️ Head-of-line blocking
HTTP/2
   ⏺️ Multiplexing
   ⏺️ Header compression
   ⏺️ Faster page loads
HTTP/3
   ⏺️ Built on QUIC (UDP)
   ⏺️ Faster handshakes
   ⏺️ Used by YouTube, Google

📌 CDN + HTTP/2/3 = massive performance boost
