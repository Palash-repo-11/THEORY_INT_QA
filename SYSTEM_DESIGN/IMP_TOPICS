🧠 SYSTEM DESIGN MASTER ROADMAP

🟢 PHASE 1: Foundations (VERY IMPORTANT)

1️⃣ What is System Design?

Functional vs Non-Functional requirements
Scalability, Reliability, Availability
Latency vs Throughput
CAP theorem (with real examples)
Vertical vs Horizontal scaling

👉 Goal: Think like an architect, not a coder.

2️⃣ Networking Basics (Interview Gold)

HTTP vs HTTPS
REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC
TCP vs UDP
WebSockets vs Long Polling
CDN (Cloudflare, Akamai)

3️⃣ Load Handling

Load Balancers (L4 vs L7)
Reverse Proxy (Nginx)
Rate Limiting (Token bucket, Leaky bucket)
Throttling vs Quotas

🟡 PHASE 2: Data Layer (Most Asked)

4️⃣ Databases (Deep Dive)

SQL vs NoSQL
MySQL vs PostgreSQL
MongoDB, DynamoDB
When to use which?
ACID vs BASE
Indexing (B-Tree, Hash Index)

5️⃣ Data Scaling Techniques

Sharding (range, hash, directory)
Replication (master-slave, multi-master)
Read replicas
Hot partitions problem

6️⃣ Caching

Redis vs Memcached
Cache-aside vs Write-through
Cache eviction (LRU, LFU)
Cache invalidation problems

“There are only two hard things in CS…”

🟠 PHASE 3: Backend Architecture

7️⃣ Monolith vs Microservices

Pros & cons
When NOT to use microservices
Service communication
API Gateway

8️⃣ Async Processing

Message Queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS)
Event-driven architecture
Exactly-once vs at-least-once
Background jobs & cron

9️⃣ File & Media Systems

Object storage (S3)
Upload/download architecture
Video streaming basics
Chunked uploads

🔵 PHASE 4: Reliability & Scale

🔟 High Availability

Failover strategies
Health checks
Circuit Breaker
Bulkhead pattern

1️⃣1️⃣ Consistency & Distributed Systems

CAP theorem (real case)
Strong vs Eventual consistency
Distributed locks
Idempotency

1️⃣2️⃣ Security

Authentication vs Authorization
JWT vs Session
OAuth 2.0
Rate limiting & DDOS protection

🔴 PHASE 5: System Design Interviews

1️⃣3️⃣ Design Large Systems

We’ll design from scratch:
URL Shortener
Instagram
YouTube
WhatsApp
Uber
Google Drive
Notification system
Search autocomplete

Each design will include:
✔ API design
✔ DB schema
✔ Scaling strategy
✔ Bottleneck analysis

🧪 PHASE 6: Real-World Practice (Optional)

Design using Node.js + Redis + Kafka
Draw architecture mentally (or on paper)
Convert designs into backend services

🛠️ Tools You Should Know

Redis
Kafka
Nginx
AWS basics (EC2, S3, RDS)
Docker (highly recommended)
