# 🔵 REDUX INTERVIEW QUESTIONS (WITH ANSWERS & CODE)

---

## 1️⃣ What is Redux?

Redux is a **state management library** used to manage **global application state** in a **predictable way**.

👉 Used when multiple components need the same data.

---

## 2️⃣ Why do we need Redux?

* Avoids **prop drilling**
* Centralized state
* Predictable data flow
* Easier debugging with DevTools

---

## 3️⃣ What are the core principles of Redux?

1. **Single source of truth** (one store)
2. **State is read-only**
3. **Changes via pure functions (reducers)**

---

## 4️⃣ What is a Store?

Store holds the **entire state tree** of the app.

```js
import { createStore } from "redux";
const store = createStore(reducer);
```

---

## 5️⃣ What is an Action?

Action is a **plain JS object** that describes **what happened**.

```js
const increment = {
  type: "INCREMENT"
};
```

---

## 6️⃣ What is an Action Creator?

A function that returns an action.

```js
const increment = () => ({
  type: "INCREMENT"
});
```

---

## 7️⃣ What is a Reducer?

Reducer is a **pure function** that updates state.

```js
const reducer = (state = { count: 0 }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

---

## 8️⃣ What does "pure function" mean?

* No side effects
* Same input → same output
* Does not mutate state

❌ Wrong

```js
state.count++;
```

✅ Correct

```js
return { count: state.count + 1 };
```

---

## 9️⃣ What is Dispatch?

Dispatch sends an action to the reducer.

```js
store.dispatch(increment());
```

---

## 🔟 What is useSelector?

Reads data from Redux store.

```js
const count = useSelector(state => state.count);
```

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ What is useDispatch?

Used to dispatch actions.

```js
const dispatch = useDispatch();
dispatch(increment());
```

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Redux Data Flow

1. UI triggers action
2. Action dispatched
3. Reducer updates state
4. UI re-renders

➡️ One-way data flow

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ What is Redux Toolkit (RTK)?

Official, recommended way to use Redux
Reduces boilerplate.

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ createSlice Example (RTK)

```js
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1; // immer allows mutation
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    }
  }
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Why mutation works in RTK?

RTK uses **Immer.js**
It converts mutation into immutable updates.

---

## 1️⃣6️⃣ How to configure store?

```js
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "./counterSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer
  }
});
```

---

## 1️⃣7️⃣ How to connect Redux with React?

```js
import { Provider } from "react-redux";

<Provider store={store}>
  <App />
</Provider>
```

---

## 1️⃣8️⃣ What is Thunk?

Used for **async logic** (API calls).

---

## 1️⃣9️⃣ createAsyncThunk Example

```js
import { createAsyncThunk, createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

export const fetchUsers = createAsyncThunk(
  "users/fetch",
  async () => {
    const res = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users");
    return res.json();
  }
);

const userSlice = createSlice({
  name: "users",
  initialState: { data: [], loading: false },
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder
      .addCase(fetchUsers.pending, (state) => {
        state.loading = true;
      })
      .addCase(fetchUsers.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        state.loading = false;
        state.data = action.payload;
      })
      .addCase(fetchUsers.rejected, (state) => {
        state.loading = false;
      });
  }
});

export default userSlice.reducer;
```

## 2️⃣0️⃣ Redux vs Context API

| Redux              | Context           |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Global state       | Small state       |
| Middleware support | No middleware     |
| Better debugging   | Limited debugging |

---

## 2️⃣1️⃣ What is Middleware?

Middleware sits between **dispatch → reducer**

Example:

* redux-thunk
* redux-logger

---

## 2️⃣2️⃣ What is Redux DevTools?

Used to:

* Inspect state
* Time travel
* Debug actions

---

## 2️⃣3️⃣ When should you use Redux?

✅ Use Redux when:

* Large app
* Shared global state
* Complex updates

❌ Avoid Redux when:

* Small app
* Local state only

---

## 2️⃣4️⃣ Difference between Redux & MobX?

Redux → Predictable, boilerplate
MobX → Less code, magic, auto tracking

---

## 2️⃣5️⃣ Common Redux Interview Traps

* Mutating state ❌
* Storing UI state globally ❌
* Overusing Redux ❌

---

## 2️⃣6️⃣ Folder Structure (Recommended)

```
src/
 ├── store/
 │    ├── index.js
 │    ├── userSlice.js
 │    └── counterSlice.js
```

---

## 2️⃣7️⃣ Can Redux replace backend?

❌ NO
Redux is client-side state only.

---

## 2️⃣8️⃣ Performance optimization in Redux

* Use memoized selectors
* Avoid large state
* Normalize data

---

## 2️⃣9️⃣ What is Normalization?

Storing data by ID instead of arrays.

---

## 3️⃣0️⃣ Final Interview Answer (One-liner)

"Redux helps manage global state in a predictable, scalable, and debuggable way using actions, reducers, and a single store."

---

## ✅ MOST IMPORTANT TO PRACTICE

* createSlice
* useSelector
* useDispatch
* createAsyncThunk
* Avoid mutation
* Redux vs Context
