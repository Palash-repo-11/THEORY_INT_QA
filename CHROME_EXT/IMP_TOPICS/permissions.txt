In Chrome extensions, permissions define what your extension is allowed to do. They are a security boundary, a store-review gate, and a performance control.

Below is a complete, practical breakdown of permissions in MV3.

1. Why Permissions Matter

Permissions control:

Which Chrome APIs you can call

Which websites you can access

What user data you can see

Whether Chrome Web Store will approve your extension

Fewer permissions = faster, safer, higher approval rate

2. Where Permissions Are Defined

In manifest.json:

{
  "permissions": [],
  "host_permissions": []
}

3. Two Main Permission Types (Critical)
A️⃣ API Permissions (permissions)

Grant access to Chrome extension APIs.

"permissions": [
  "storage",
  "tabs",
  "alarms"
]


Examples:

storage → use chrome.storage

tabs → read tab info

alarms → schedule background work

B️⃣ Host Permissions (host_permissions)

Grant access to websites / URLs.

"host_permissions": [
  "https://example.com/*"
]


Controls:

Content script injection

Network access (fetch)

Request modification (DNR)

4. Common Permissions (What They Do)
Permission	Purpose	Risk level
storage	Save data	Low
tabs	Tab info	Medium
activeTab	Temporary tab access	Low
scripting	Inject scripts	Medium
alarms	Scheduled tasks	Low
notifications	Show notifications	Low
declarativeNetRequest	Block/modify requests	Medium
identity	OAuth	High
cookies	Access cookies	High
webNavigation	Track page navigation	Medium
5. activeTab vs tabs (Very Important)
activeTab
"permissions": ["activeTab"]


Temporary access

Granted after user clicks extension

Much safer

Preferred by store review

tabs
"permissions": ["tabs"]


Persistent access

Can see all tabs

Higher review scrutiny

👉 Use activeTab whenever possible

6. Optional Permissions (Request at Runtime)
Declare optional permissions
"optional_permissions": [
  "tabs",
  "https://api.example.com/*"
]

Request them dynamically
chrome.permissions.request({
  permissions: ["tabs"],
  origins: ["https://api.example.com/*"]
});


✅ Better UX
✅ Higher approval chance
❌ More code complexity

7. Content Scripts & Permissions

Content scripts require:

Matching host_permissions

Or activeTab

"content_scripts": [
  {
    "matches": ["https://example.com/*"],
    "js": ["content.js"]
  }
]


Without permission → script won’t inject.

8. Dangerous Permissions (Use Sparingly)

Chrome Web Store flags these:

Permission	Why
<all_urls>	Access to all sites
cookies	Session hijacking risk
webRequest	Deprecated
identity	Account access
nativeMessaging	OS-level access

Expect manual review if used.

9. Permission Best Practices
✅ Do

Use least privilege

Narrow host patterns

Prefer activeTab

Use optional permissions

Explain permissions in description

❌ Don’t

Use <all_urls> casually

Request unused permissions

Hide permission usage

Request everything “just in case”

10. Store Review Tips (Real-World)

Chrome reviewers check:

Permission → feature alignment

Overbroad access

Missing privacy policy

Undocumented data use

Mismatch example:

“Why does a theme switcher need cookies?”

❌ Rejected.

11. Example: Well-Scoped Manifest
{
  "permissions": [
    "storage",
    "activeTab"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://api.myapp.com/*"
  ]
}


Clean. Safe. Approve-friendly.
